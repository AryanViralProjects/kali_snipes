Tier 1 Speed Engine Upgrade Plan for Kali Sniper BotThis document outlines the critical steps to transform your bot's speed and execution model from a reactive, high-latency system to a proactive, low-latency "Tier 1" sniper.Objective: Reduce detection and trade execution time from seconds/minutes to milliseconds.Part 1: Real-Time Detection via Helius WebSocketsProblem: The current method of polling the Jupiter API (get_jupiter_tokens) is too slow. By the time a token appears there, it's already been sniped.Solution: We will connect directly to your Helius RPC via a WebSocket and listen for new pool creation events in real-time.Step 1.1: Install Necessary LibrariesYou will need a Python library capable of handling asynchronous operations and WebSocket connections. websockets is the standard.pip install websockets asyncio
Step 1.2: Create the WebSocket Listener ScriptCreate a new Python file, for example, raydium_listener.py. This script will be responsible for maintaining a persistent connection to Helius and parsing incoming data.# raydium_listener.py

Step 1.3: Integration PlanThe raydium_listener.py script will run as a separate, persistent process.When process_new_pool is triggered, instead of just printing, it will:Use your Helius HTTPS RPC to call getTransaction with the signature.Parse the transaction response to find the two token mint addresses involved in the initialize2 instruction.Pass these token addresses to your existing filtering and buying logic (security_check, market_buy).Part 2: High-Speed Jupiter ExecutionProblem: The current market_buy function is a multi-step process (get quote, then send swap) which adds significant latency.Solution: We will modify the function to get the swap transaction directly and send it with skipPreflight to minimize confirmation time.Step 2.1: Modify nice_funcs.pyYour market_buy function needs a critical evolution.# In nice_funcs.py

Step 2.2: Integration PlanReplace the logic in your open_position function in nice_funcs.py to call this new market_buy_fast function.You will need to pass your Keypair object and the Client object to the function when you call it. It's best to initialize these once in your main bot script and pass them down.The amount will need to be calculated in lamports (your USDC_SIZE * 1,000,000).By completing these two parts, you will fundamentally change how your bot operates. It will no longer be waiting for information; it will be acting on events as they happen on-chain, which is the defining characteristic of a Tier 1 sniper bot.
