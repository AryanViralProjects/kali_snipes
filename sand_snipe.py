# Sniper bot for solana based on Sandwich Attack MEV Stratgey
# What is Sandwich Attacks: Combining frontrunning and backrunning: the bot buys just before a large order (pushing up price), lets the victim’s trade execute, then sells into the inflated price—extracting slippage from the victim’s transaction
# Frontrunning: Observing a large pending transaction in the public mempool, then submitting a nearly identical order with a higher fee so it is processed first—profiting from the price movement caused by the original trade
# Backrunning: Placing a follow-up trade immediately after a target transaction to capitalize on its price impact (e.g., selling into the price spike created by a large buy order)
